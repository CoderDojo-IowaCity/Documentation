# Thanks for attending CoderDojo Iowa City!

CoderDojo Iowa City is a free and fun place where Johnson County's kids learn how to code, supported by mentors and
parents! We hope you have a great time.

Kids, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a
playground. That's one of the reasons we refer to students of the dojo as "ninjas".
Ultimately, you get to decide what programming languages,
tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. And, all of us:
mentors, other ninjas, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can
always ask a mentor about things that interest you, or any other questions you
have.

## Online registraton for sessions

CoderDojo Iowa City uses Eventbrite.com's ticketing system to reserve spaces for ninjas at each session. Visit http://coderdojoic.eventbrite.com and click the event link to reserve spots for a session.  

Parents should reserve a 'Parent' ticket for themselves only if they are planning to attend with their ninja(s). You will need to reserve 'Ninja' tickets for every session your ninja(s) attends. This will helps us to know how many mentors we will need to adequately run the dojo.  Please specify the name of the ninja(s) on each ticket seperately so we can prepare name tags in advance. 

Mentors are asked to reserve tickets > 1 week in advance of the dojo date to help the organizers.  :smiley:

## Parents and ninjas

### Before attending a session
See our [Web Browsers](web_browsers.md) page for suggestions regarding the web browser used during coding sessions.

Parents, please create an account on [our website](https://coderdojoic.org) and one of the following:

  * [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com)
  * [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu)

on behalf of each ninja. Your ninja will need to use the same login information for each CoderDojo session.  Ninja(s) who would like to learn programming concepts with minimal typing involved should be registered for Scratch.  Other ninjas should be registered for Codecademy.

In the rare event that we have to cancel or move the dojo, we will make every effort to communicate that information via
  * [Facebook](www.facebook.com/CoderDojoIACity), 
  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/CoderDojoIACity), and 
  * our [Zen page](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/68).  

:warning: If there is any conflicting information, the Zen page is _guaranteed_ to be correct. 

### What to bring

  * A laptop for your ninja. If you do not have access to a laptop
    please email coderdojo.iowa.city@gmail.com and we will try to make one available for you.

In case there are difficulties connecting to the internet, please have the following software installed on the ninja's laptop
**before** they come. Contact us ASAP if you are having installation trouble and we will try to provide thumb drives with the necessary software at the session.

#### Scratch ninjas
##### Suggested age: 5-6+
Scratch is a visual programming language.  Coders drag-and-drop command blocks to connect tasks together.  Simple interface but expansive enough to challenge seasoned programmers as well.
  - [ ] install Scratch from [http://scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu)

#### JavaScript and HTML/CSS ninjas
##### Suggested age: 7-8+
Web technologies are the basis of the Internet and can be used to create personal web pages or online games you can share with your friends.  It's suggested that coders have a good grasp of reading, writing, and basic math. Some ability to type is helpful.
  - [ ] install Brackets [http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/) or Notepad++ [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org).

#### Java and Minecraft ninjas _(ADVANCED)_
##### Suggested age: 12+
Minecraft is one of the most popular games to be created and it's written completely in Java, an 'object-oriented' programming language.  Ninjas should be able to read well and understand how to organize and rewrite code.  Having one beginner language badge from any CoderDojo is __required__.  
  - [ ] install Eclipse from [https://eclipse.org/downloads/](https://eclipse.org/downloads/)
  - [ ] download latest Minecraft Forge source code and documentation from [http://files.minecraftforge.net/](http://files.minecraftforge.net/). You want the **recommended** _"Src"_ and _"Javadoc"_ files.  _Hint: to avoid the AdFly waiting page, click the "\*" link that's to the right of "Src" and "Javadoc"_
  - [ ] install Forge following these instructions on the wiki: [http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source)

## Getting here

We are **usually** at the [Iowa City Public
Library](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iowa+City+Public+Library), but please check our Zen page https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/68 for updates!

##### ALL dojo updates will be done on our Zen page: https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/68

## Key Times

  * 1:30 PM: Volunteers begin setting up
  * 1:50 PM: Doors open - parents and ninjas check in
  * 2:00 PM: Welcome and kickoff -- Mentors will describe the goals for
    their group and coding begins.
  * 3:15 PM: Sessions wind up -- Mentors seek feedback from the ninjas
    about the session and ask them what they want to try next time
  * 3:20 PM: Show-and-tell -- ninjas demostrate new discoveries or solutions to challenges
  * 3:30 PM: Volunteers begin shutting down

### When you arrive

Parents and ninjas check in at the 2nd floor computer lab. A mentor will help you sign in and guide you to the appropriate seat. Ninjas should get a name tag and print their first name on their name tag.

Ninjas can join another group at any time.  Ninjas younger than 12 who are complete beginners are encouraged to join the Scratch group.  We encourage the parent and ninja to discuss and decided what session their ninja attends.  Talk to a mentor for advice on what session your ninja should attend.

## Mentors
Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 8 ninjas.  Having a limit on the number of ninjas per mentor makes sure that ninjas who register are able to receive adequate attention.

## Learning resources before your first session or in between sessions

Please see our **[Online learning guide](http://www.coderdojoic.org/learning-guide)**. In it, you'll find lots of great free resources
that you should study and practice with in your own time on the following learning tracks:

  * Scratch
  * HTML/CSS
  * JavaScript


You should start on one or more of these tracks so that you'll have good questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you
visit the dojo in person.

### Highly recommended

We highly encourage you to utilize the free lessons and projects on
**Codecademy** and **Learnstreet**, and other online resources.

# Have fun and learn a lot! Let us know how we're doing too!

We want you to have fun and learn lots of new things! We also love your
feedback and want to know what kinds of ideas you have and what you want
to learn, so let us know when you visit! Thanks!
