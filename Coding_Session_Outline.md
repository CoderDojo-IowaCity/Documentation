# Thanks for attending CoderDojo McDonough -- **_a free and fun place
where Henry County's kids learn how to code, supported by mentors and
parents! **We hope you have a great time.

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a
playground. Ultimately, you get to decide what programming languages,
tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. And, all of us:
mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can
always ask a mentor about things that interest you, or any other questions you
have.

## Software to install before attending a session

In case there are difficulties connecting to the internet at the
library, please have the following software installed on the student's laptop
before they come. Thumb drives will be available with the necessary software if you are unable to install the software before the
session.

**Scratch students: **install Scratch from
[http://scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu)

**JavaScript and HTML/CSS students:** install the free editor Brackets
from [http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/) or
another popular code editor like Sublime Text 2.


## When you arrive

Parents and students check in at the library lobby. A mentor will sign you in and guide you to the appropriate session room. Students should get a name tag and print their first name on their name tag.

Students can join another session at any time.  Students 7 - 12 who are complete beginners are encouraged to join the Scratch group.  We encourage the parent and student to discuss and decided what session their student attends.  Talk to a mentor for advice on what session your student should attend.

## Online RSVPs

CoderDojo McDonough uses Meetup.com's RSVP system to reserve spaces for students at each sessions. For each session the parent should RSVP for their students. Visit our website and click the "RSVP for a session" link to reserve your student's spot for a session.  You will need to RSVP separately for all sessions you want your student to attend.

Due to the high demand for our program, attendees who are not registered
on our [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) site will not be allowed to sit in a room holding a session with mentors. Students who are not on our RSVP list will wait in a standby area. If the room is full
to capacity with registered students, students not on the RSVP will be allowed
to wait in the staging area, move to another dojo session with availability,
or students can sit in other available library seating area and work on
code learning websites. Mentors will do our best that all
students in the library have access to a text editor or Scratch and
ability to view learning material. If not enough registered students are present by 1:30pm, dojo coordinators will begin to allow waiting students to sit in the session room.

Parents should only RSVP for the number of students participating and do
not include parents or guardians. This will allow us to know how many students to allow based on our number of mentors.

## Advanced Student Signup

We encourage intermediate or advanced students to register using our
Advanced Student Signup form at [http://www.coderdojohenry/AdvancedStudentSignup](http:
//www.coderdojohenry/AdvancedStudentSignup). This will allow the coordinators to match students with mentors.
Students who register as an Advanced Student but do not RSVP to our Meetup site for a session may not be able to attend the session they want.

Learning resources before your first session or in between sessions

Please see our **[Students getting started and online learning guide
](/learning-guide)**. In it, you'll find lots of great free resources
that you
should study and practice with in your own time on the following
learning
tracks:

  * Beginning Scratch
  * Beginning HTML/CSS
  * Beginning JavaScript
  * Intermediate HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  * Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript with Minecraft mods
  * Hardware hacking with Raspberry Pi or Arduino and JavaScript.

You should start on one or more of these tracks so that you'll have good
questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you
visit the
dojo in person.

### Highly recommended

_We highly encourage you to utilize the free lessons and projects on
**Codecademy** and **Learnstreet**, and other online resources.
