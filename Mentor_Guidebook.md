#### Divide dojo into groups
Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 10 students.  You can help any student, but try to have a certain number of students who you can make sure are not ignored.  We try to ensure all students have access to a code editor and can view learning material.  

Pair programming should be encouraged even when space may be available.
