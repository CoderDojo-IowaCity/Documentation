#### Groups
Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 8-10 students.  Mentors can help any student, but try to have a certain number of students who you can make sure are not ignored.  Mentors try to ensure all students in the library have access to a code editor and the ability to view learning material.  We help all students whenever possible.
