# CoderDojo Ponce Springs Events 

Thanks for attending CoderDojo Ponce Springs -- a free and fun place where Atlanta's kids learn how to code, 
supported by mentors and parents! We hope you have a great time.

All events follow a basic agenda:

# Key Times

* 1:00 PM: Volunteers begin setting up
* 1:45 PM: Doors open, parents and students: please sign in at the sign in table
* 2:15 PM: Welcome and kickoff -- Workshop leaders will describe the workshops areas, and students will pick and get settled in
* 4:30 PM: Sessions wind up -- Workshop leaders seek feedback from the students about the session and ask them 
what they want to try next time
* 5:00 PM: Volunteers begin shutting down

# Info for Parents

## Getting here and parking

See [PARKING.md](../PARKING.md) for info on getting here and where to park -- **and where to avoid parking**!

## What to bring

* Bring a laptop for your child. We don't have any loaner laptops this time.
* We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd like to bring some other snacks to share, 
that would be great.

# Info for Students

## Special Reminder

Students, remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide 
what programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to explore, learn, and play with. 
And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents are here to help you learn and have fun.

We want you to feel free to pursue what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that 
interest you, or any other questions you have.

## What to do before coming to Coder Dojo, and in between sessions

Please see our **[Students getting started and online learning guide](https://github.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/Events/blob/master/Students_Getting_Started.md)**. It has lots of great free resources that you should study and practice with in your own time so that you'll have good questions and ideas for what you'd like to learn more about when you visit the dojo in person. We highly encourage you to utilize the free lessons and projects on **Codecademy** and **Learnstreet**, and other online resources.

## When you arrive

We'll have have multiple work areas, some set up as workshops broken down for different student skill 
levels. 

## What's your current experience with coding?

If you want to start with one of the workshops, see where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further

# Workshop Sessions Summaries

Each session will begin around 2:15, so pick one of these by then. You don't have to stick with the same 
session the whole time, and we'll be repeating them at least for a few more sessions.
