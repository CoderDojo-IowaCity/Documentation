## Mentor Guidebook


# Groups
Mentors are encouraged to lead groups with no more than 8 students.  The maximum number of students per mentor is 10 students for one mentor.  Mentors can help any student, but try to have a certain number of students who you make sure are not ignored.  We want to make sure we help all students.  Mentors will try to make sure all students in the library have access to a code editor and the ability to view learning material.


# Mentor Assignments
The coordinators will send out a suggested list of mentor assignments for each session and experience group.  Mentor assignments are only a suggestion.  Mentors can contact each other to change their assignments, either at the Dojo or via email.  Please be flexible - we may need to pull you into another session or experience group on the day of a session.  Once an exploratory group is formed with 6 or more students, we will not pull the exploratory group's mentor to help with other sessions.


# Research welcome!
Mentors are encouraged to search for good online and offline teaching tools.  Please post any other techniques and plans you find on this or a new discussion thread.
