# Guidelines
At CoderDojo Iowa City, we encourage active learning over passive, open and honest collaboration, and flexible thinking.  As such, we encourage mentors to follow these guidelines.

 * Students learn by doing, so mentors don't touch the keyboard.
 * Students learn when they are engaged, so mentors prefer discussions over presentations.
 * Frustration and discouragement are the enemy of learning, so mentors monitor student behavior and redirect appropriately.
 * Project-based learning is fluid - there are no lesson plans for the dojo, only individual objectives and goals.
 * Mentors know there are many ways of accomplishing a given task and allow ninjas to explore different methods.
 * Failure is encouraged and celebrated.  Mentors know the 'best' solution isn't the best way to learn: more retention is gained through mistakes than success.  So mentors let students run and solve faulty code regularly.
 * Mentors give students the tools to succeed in isolation.  A mentor's measure of success is a student who no longer needs their help.  Therefore, mentors are selfless.
 * Mentors show students that coding is a social exercise.  Mentors encourage students to become active in projects they didn't create, to communicate honestly with those around them, and to avoid criticism of others work.

# Becoming a mentor

CoderDojo Iowa City is seeking developers of all skill levels who are interested in sharing their knowledge with local youth at CoderDojo Iowa City. CoderDojo is a worldwide non-profit group founded to teach young people (ages 6-18) to code. Visit [http://coderdojo.com](http://coderdojo.com) for more information about the CoderDojo movement.

Developers with any experience or even non-developers who can Google and type well are welcome to serve as mentors!

Coding sessions are held at the Iowa City Public Library every Saturday unless otherwise noted. The number of students allowed to participate each month will be based on mentor participation, so we really need your help to make CoderDojo Iowa City a success!
