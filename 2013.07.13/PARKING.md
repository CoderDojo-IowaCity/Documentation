# Parking for CoderDojo Ponce Springs at Ponce Springs Lofts

# Findiing Us
* We're in the bottom floor of the Ponce Springs building at 620 Glen Iris Drive, at the corner of Glen Iris 
and North Avenue, near Ponce City Market (gigantic old City Hall East / Sears building) and directly across the
street from Dancing Goats Coffee. 
* We're adjacent to the Gecko Sushi restaurant

# Visitor Parking

* **Visitor parking in the Ponce Springs Lofts parking deck can be limited!**

# Parking Alternatives

* Alternatively, you may be able to find a spot at the credit union 
just up the hill on North Avenue toward Kennesaw Avenue on the right side 
(towards downtown; opposite direction of Ponce City Market & Dancing Goats Coffee)
 * The credit union is closed on Saturday and the parking lot is usually empty. 
I don't know if this officially approved, however
* There are other side streets off of Glen Iris and North Avenue that you can try also
* **I don't advise you to park in Dancing Goats lot**, as it is private. The security for Ponce Springs Market is 
very strict about this, and we do not have official approval for visitors to park there.
 * However, if you purchase a coffee or something from Dancing Goats, then you are their customer for the day.
