# CoderDojo Ponce Springs 7/13/2013 Event Outline and Resources

# Message to Students:

Remember that the dojo is partly a classroom, but mostly a **playground**. Ultimately, you get to decide what 
programming languages, tools, and ideas you want to play with. And, all of us: mentors, other students, and parents
are here to help you learn and have fun.

We're here to help you learn what is interesting to you. You can always ask a mentor about things that interest you,
or about questions you have.

We even have a special **Any Question Any Time** area where you can come to ask questions that might be 
totally different from what is happening in the workshop areas. Or you can come there with your laptop and 
just work on whatever you want to and get help from mentors or other students.

# For Parents:

## Getting here and parking

See [PARKING.md](PARKING.md) for info on getting here and where to park!

## What to bring

* Bring a laptop for your child. We don't have any loaner laptops this time.
* We'll have soft drinks and water and a some snacks, but if you'd like to bring some other snacks to share, 
that would be great.

# For Parents and Students

## When you arrive

Students: we'll have have multiple work areas, some set up as workshops broken down for different student skill levels, and
another one called **Any Question Any Time** for you to talk with mentors about anything you want.

Parents: you're welcome in the **Any Question Any Time** area too :-), but students get priority!

## Students: what's your current experience with coding?

If you want to start with one of the workshops, see where you fit against these descriptions:

* **Beginner level**: You are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development

* **Intermediate level**: You have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, 
object-oriented programming, events, and web programming

* **Advanced level**: You have already been programming for a while and have your own project that you'd like to 
discuss with other students or mentors that can help you go further

## Workshop Sessions

Each session will begin around 2:15, so pick one of these by then. You don't have to stick with the same 
session the whole time, and we'll be repeating them at least for a few more sessions.

* For **beginner level** students:

  * **Workshop A-1:** Learn HTML and CSS basics
  
  `or`
  
  * **Workshop A-2:** Build your own web site
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop B:** Build a simple game with Python

* For **intermediate level** students:

  * **Workshop C:** Build the classic arcade game Pong in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  
  `or`

  * **Workshop D:** Make battling JavaScript robots!

## Any Question Any Time area

* For students with other questions, or who are at an **advanced level**
  * Drop by the **Any Question Any Time** area to ask questions related to your own projects or ask how 
you can get started on something that interests you, but is different from the other workshops.

**Note:** *we'll likely offer these same or similar sessions on an ongoing basis at future events so 
don't feel like you're missing out on anything. You can always try the others later or even do the 
materials on your own or with friends!*

**Keep reading for all details.**

# Full details

**Note:** The beginner's `Python Game` session requires special software to download ahead of time. And, if you want 
to start creating a web page on your laptop that you can save for later, we recommend you download 
[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

# Beginner level workshops

For students of any age that are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development.

## Workshop A-1: Learn HTML and CSS basics (Very similar to the first event's Workshop A)

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

No special installation required. We will use an online HTML Chat tool that lets you experiment with HTML easily
and share code with your friends.

### What you’ll learn

Learn the basics of what Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tags are and how you use them to create web pages. 
You'll also learn how to change text colors, sizes, and add borders using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
You'll learn how to create moving text, and flashing text also. And, you can share your favorite examples with 
your friends.

### Resources for going further after this tutorial

There are lots more HTML tags that can be used for creating all kinds of cool pages. Here are some places to learn more:

* W3 Schools provides a good reference of HTML tags: http://www.w3schools.com
* Code Avengers 3-Level HTML adventure learning: http://www.codeavengers.com/ (You can also learn JavaScript for apps and games!)

## Workshop A-2: Build your own web site (Slightly more advanced than A-1)

For students of any age that have done Workshop A, and would like to create a page that they can save on their
laptop or publish online for friends and family to see.

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

We recommend you download and install the free [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) editor.

### What you’ll learn

Learn how to take what you learned in Workshop A, (HTML and CSS), to build your own web page that you can save
on your laptop and/or publish online. You'll also learn how to create HTML tables, lists. If you get through
those topics, you'll then start to build some HTML forms that viewers of your web site can use to 
give you feedback on your site.

## Workshop B: Build a simple game with Python.

You can find the complete instructions and lesson plan [here](pygame/README.md).

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

For this workshop you will need Python installed on your computer.  We will be using the latest version of Python, which is 3.3.2.  However, if you already happened to have an older version of Python installed on your computer, it will work just fine.

programming JavaScript with functions, object-orientation and inheritance, events, and more.
  
### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Fighting robots are popular in other languages too, but so are real, physical robots. Here are some resources:

# Any Question Any Time area

* Are you interested in learning something that we don't yet have a workshop about?
* Or, have you been building something on your own or with friends that you'd like some help with?
* Or, are you mostly interested in subjects that you're not sure how coding might fit in with?

If you're been writing code for a while and already have projects you're working on and goals for 
problems you're trying to solve, we want to hear about it! We'll do our best to help you or find you
the help you need!

You can even help us set the goals for future workshops and events!

## Resources for learning more on your own or with friends
