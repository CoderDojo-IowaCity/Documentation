# Introduction

Today we're going to learn how to program computer games.  Writing computer games are probably one of
the most complicated things programmers can do, but we can get started with a very simple game, just
to see what it's like.

I hope all of you got a chance to go through http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ that I recommended last time.
If you haven't or you're new, it's OK, you should be able to keep up as well.
