PyGame Workshop
============================

# Introduction

Today we're going to learn how to program computer games.  Writing computer games are probably one of
the most complicated things programmers can do, but we can get started with a very simple game, just
to see what it's like.

I hope all of you got a chance to go through http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ that I recommended last time.
If you haven't or you're new, it's OK, you should be able to keep up as well.

# Setup Environment

To use **Python** we need to put it on your computer first.  You should have it installed already, 
so let's check to see if it's already on your computer.

* press the **Start** button
* type in `idle`
* press *Enter*

If you don't have **Python** on your computer:

## Install Python:

For this class we will be using **Python** version 2.7.5.  Any 2.7 version of **Python**
is OK, but any 3.x version is not.  If you installed **Python** 3.3 on your computer last time,
remove **Python** 3.3 and install **Python** 2.7.5.

* go to www.python.org
* click on `DOWNLOAD`
* click on `Python 2.7.5 Windows x86 MSI Installer`
* once the file downloads, click on it
* keep clicking **Next** in the installer until the installation starts
* click **Yes** to allow **Python** to install
* click **Finish**

## Install a Python IDE:

IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment", it makes it easier and faster 
for programmers to develop software.  We will be using an excellent free Python IDE for 
Windows called **PyScripter**.  Let's download and install it:

* go to https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/downloads/detail?name=PyScripter-v2.5.3-Setup.exe
* click on `PyScripter-v2.5.3-Setup.exe` to start download
* once the file downloads, click on it
* Keep clicking *Next*, then *Install*, *PyScripter* will install
* Click *Next*, then *Finish* to exit the installer and to start *PyScripter*

# Setup for Game Development

* get all the files from the `PyMan` directory in this repository
* create a directory called `PyMan` in a known location
* in the `PyMan` directory, create a directory called `data`
* in the data directory, create a directory called `images`
* copy `pellet.png` and `snake.png` into the `images` directory
