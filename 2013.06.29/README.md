# CoderDojo Ponce Springs 6/29/2013 Event Outline and Resources

Here is what we'll have available on the first session. Please read over the 

# Beginner level students

For students of any age that are totally new or have little exposure to programming and / or web development.

## Tutorial / Workshop 1: Building your own web site

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

No special installation required. We will use https://thimble.webmaker.org/, a free online HTML editor that lets you save and publish pages instantly to share with friends.

### What you’ll learn

Learn how to use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and graphics to build your own web sites.

### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Creating your own web page with Thimble is really just the beginning of what you can do on the web! Try these out:

* Mozilla’s Popcorn Maker: mash up YouTube videos, SoundCloud, or HTMl5 content into fun videos and collages: https://popcorn.webmaker.org/editor/ 
* Code Avengers 3-Level HTML adventure learning: http://www.codeavengers.com/ (You can also learn JavaScript for apps and games!)
* HTMl5 Rocks web site with lots of tutorials: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials 

## Tutorial / Workshop 2: Learn to Program with Python

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

Download PythonTurtle for Windows at http://pythonturtle.org/. 

### What you’ll learn

Use the popular and fun Python programming language to animate a turtle and learn key programming and Python concepts like for loops, ranges, and defining functions to create reusable code libraries to share with friends.

### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Now that you know the basics, you’re ready to become an expert. Here are some resources for going deeper:

* Learn Python online through an interactive step-by-step tutorial (without any download) at http://www.learnpython.org/
* Ready to download Python and run it directly on your computer?  You can download the full Python language for Windows, Mac, or Linux from http://www.python.org/getit/
* Feeling like a challenge? Try http://learnpythonthehardway.org/!
* Tons of more learning resources for Python here: http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers  

# Intermediate level students

For students who have some experience with coding, but want to dig into concepts like game development, object-oriented programming, events, and web programming.

## Tutorial / Workshop: Build the classic arcade game Pong in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

No installation required. We’ll be using the free http://www.codepen.io, which allows you to author code and save it for sharing with others.

### What you’ll learn

Learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the classic arcade game Pong. You’ll learn about animation, using object-orientation in JavaScript, and gaming concepts like collision detection.

### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Pong is an arcade classic, no doubt. But, maybe you want to recreate some of the other classic games? Or, do you want to learn more about animation, 3D, etc? Try some of these:

* HTML5 Game Development course at Udacity taught by a Google Chrome engineer: https://www.udacity.com/course/cs255 
* Lots of resources for building HTML5 games: http://www.html5gamedevelopment.com/html5-engines 
* Great collection of HTML5 games tutorials and tools: http://html5games.com/resources/ 

## Tutorial / Workshop: Battling JavaScript Robots!

### Software to install on your laptop before you attend

No installation required. We’ll be using the free site http://fightcodegame.com/. You can study the documentation here: http://fightcodegame.com/docs/ 

### What you’ll learn

Create virtual robots that battle each other head to head and rack up points while learning more about 
programming JavaScript with functions, object-orientation and inheritance, events, and more.
  
### Resources for going further after this tutorial

Fighting robots are popular in other languages too, but so are real, physical robots. Here are some resources:

* Robocode: develop robot battle tanks to fight each other: http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ (This is what FightCodeGame.com is based on)
* Lego Mindstorms: write code to make *real* robots move and do all kinds of things: http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx
* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects and environments: http://www.arduino.cc/ 

# Advanced level students

For students who have been writing code for a while and may already have projects they are working on.

## Open space and pair programming lab

In the world of technology an "open space" is a place where people show up, start talking, and then decide what to do. 
There is no "master plan" that's fixed ahead of time. Instead, you help set the agenda!

And, "pair programming" simply means that two developers team up to work on some code together. They take turns writing
code and thinking strategically about what to do next.

### What you'll do

We'll have mentors you can talk to about your goals and what kinds of code you have already written and want to write
now to take yourself to the next level.

Perhaps we'll start coding something new and advanced just for fun, but it will depend on what everyone's goals are.
