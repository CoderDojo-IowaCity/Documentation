# Parking for CoderDojo Ponce Springs at Ponce Springs Lofts

With so many people signed up, parking may become an issue. 

* We're in the bottom floor of the Ponce Springs building at 620 Glen Iris Drive, at the corner of Glen Iris 
and North Avenue, near Ponce City Market (gigantic old City Hall East / Sears building) and directly across the
street from Dancing Goats Coffee. 
* We're adjacent to the Gecko Sushi restaurant
* Visitor parking in the Ponce Springs Lofts parking deck can be limited!
* Alternatively, you may be able to find a spot just up North Avenue toward Kennesaw Avenue. 
* There is a small parking lot at the intersection of Kennesaw and North Avenue for a professional building that is
usually empty in the evenings and weekends. 
* **I don't advise you to park in Dancing Goats lot**, as it is private. The security for Ponce Springs Market is 
very strict about this.
