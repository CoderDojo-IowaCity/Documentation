# Parking for CoderDojo Ponce Springs at Ponce Springs Lofts

With so many people signed up and a local festival taking, parking will be an issue.

**Important Note:** You can park in the rear section of the Ponce City Market covered deck, behind Dancing Goats! Thanks to Dancing Goat's manager Hillary
for being accommodating to us. Please thank them with a coffee purchase and a thank you!

Look for a CoderDojo volunteer in a white T-shirt directing you to the parking.

* We're in the bottom floor of the Ponce Springs building at 620 Glen Iris Drive, at the corner of Glen Iris 
and North Avenue, near Ponce City Market (gigantic old City Hall East / Sears building) and directly across the
street from Dancing Goats Coffee. 
* We're adjacent to the Gecko Sushi restaurant
* **Visitor parking in the Ponce Springs Lofts parking deck can be limited!**
* Alternatively, you may be able to find a spot just up North Avenue toward Kennesaw Avenue on the right side 
(opposite direction of Ponce City Market & Dancing Goats Coffee)
 * *There is a small parking lot at the intersection of Kennesaw and North Avenue for a professional building that is
usually empty in the evenings and weekends.* 
* There are other side streets off of Glen Iris and North Avenue that you can try also
* **I don't advise you to park in Dancing Goats lot**, as it is private. The security for Ponce Springs Market is 
very strict about this.
