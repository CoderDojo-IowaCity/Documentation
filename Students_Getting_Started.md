Students, you should complete the resources below at home to strengthen you skills. **New students, you should 
start on these even before you attend your first dojo, to see what inspires you and what you want to get
help with.**

You can also try the official CoderDojo Kata wiki, but sometimes those resources are not updated as often as they should be:

# Resources developed by CoderDojo Ponce Springs mentors!

Some of the mentors in our dojo have been developing resources of their own for you.

We're working on organizing the materials better for you, but you can find them all linked from the README.md files 
inside the folders corresponding to previous events here: [CoderDojoPonceSprings.Events](https://github.com/JogoShugh/CoderDojoPonceSprings.Events)

# More resources

Code.org keeps a good "jumping off" point for online learning [right here](http://www.code.org/learn/codehs).

# And even more!

You are not limited to learning these languages in our dojo! It's just that, so far, this is what most students 
have expressed interest in, and what most mentors have experience with. If you have other goals and ideas, just 
let us know and we'll do our best to help you get started or take what you've already done even further.

And, if you find other great online resources, let us know!
