# Students, here's how to get started

As of August, 2013, we have had several regular learning "tracks":

* Beginning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Intermediate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Beginning Python
* Intermediate to Advanced Python with Learnstreet.com Projects
* Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript with Fighting Robots
* Intermediate to Advanced JavaScript with Learnstreet.com Projects
* Scratch

Here are some resources students in each of these tracks should pursue at home to strengthen skills:

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript tracks:

[Codecademy Web Fundamentals](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)

You will probably want to follow the JavaScript tutorials linked in the JavaScript track section below also!

## Python tracks:

## JavaScript tracks:

[Codecademy JavaScript tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)

## For all the above tracks:

Once you've done the Codecademy lessons, try to find some fun projects and more materials from Learnstreet:

## Scratch

* [How to download Scratch](https://github.com/versionone/CoderDojo-ScratchDemo/blob/master/README.md)
* [Scratch Tutorial](http://scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__1374511755__//pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf)
* [Free scratch video course](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/learning-programming-scratch)

You can also try the official CoderDojo Kata wiki, but sometimes those resources are not updated as often as they should be:

# Resources developed by CoderDojo Ponce Springs mentors!

Some of the mentors in our dojo have been developing resources of their own for you.

We're working on organizing the materials better for you, but you can find them all linked from the README.md files 
inside the folders corresponding to previous events here: [CoderDojoPonceSprings.Events](https://github.com/JogoShugh/CoderDojoPonceSprings.Events)

# More resources

Code.org keeps a good "jumping off" point for online learning [right here](http://www.code.org/learn/codehs).

# And even more!

You are not limited to learning these languages in our dojo! It's just that, so far, this is what most students 
have expressed interest in, and what most mentors have experience with. If you have other goals and ideas, just 
let us know and we'll do our best to help you get started or take what you've already done even further.

And, if you find other great online resources, let us know!
