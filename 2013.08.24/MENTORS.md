CoderDojo Prep Session Notes:

Open question: How to best support multiple levels of skill?

- Scoreboard style -- Basic, Intermediate, Advanced (See Khan)
- CodeAcademy -- and other existing resources

- Ask on CoderDojo forums: 
	- Implement this? http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/
		- Josh: find more info on this, post on Forums, ask Rebecca from NYC	
		- Josh: send request to mailing list to ask parents if their kids would be interested in helping other newbies
		- See also: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges
		- OpenHatch model: https://openhatch.org/
- How to see "current step / goal" for a student?		
- Stations idea: 
  -   Topical, "staffed" by a mentor to help a student get something specific done, like:
    - Get Python installed
    - Get WebMatrix
    - Get Sublime Text 2/3 installed
    - Download Bootstrap
    - Download JQuery
    - etc
    - Language Trouble shooting station / Debugging station
- Admin ideas: http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Administrative_Resources


Josh: Tic Tac Toe -> JavaScript 

Jim notes:

- Not seeing self-direction yet
- Keep momentum
- Many still, and will still, see this as a classroom, not a gymnasium
