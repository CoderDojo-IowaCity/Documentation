# Draft message to parents, students, and mentors:

Hello everyone,

Now that we've done this four times, we've started to see a lot of the same students and mentors coming back each time. This is a great thing! 

But, students, we want to make sure you feel like:

1. You're learning new things you want to master when you attend
2. You can help other students learn things that you know already

And, mentors, we want to make sure you feel like:

1. You are able to help students, but without feeling like you have to create lots of materials yourself (but please do if you'd like to!)
2. You get the opportunity to learn new things too!

Here are some ideas we're considering implementing:

1. **CoderDojo.com's Badge system** -- lets students gain recognition for a variety things: attending, skills they learn, helping others, etc. More info:
    * http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/
    * http://www.hastac.org/blogs/rcitow/2013/05/30/design-principles-assessing-learning-digital-badges
    * https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups=#!topic/coderdojo-org/at6Zk9k5CoY

2. **Use existing free learning resources** -- this will help intermediate to advanced students dig into self-directed learning and projects. As mentors, we would familiarize ourselves with these materials in order to be able to help and guide students in their path. Some examples:
    * Self-guided lessons:
        * Codecademy lessons:
            * Web Fundamentals (Building a Site): http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web
            * JavaScript: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
            * Python: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python
            * More: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks
        * Code Avengers: http://www.codeavengers.com/
    * Self-guided projects:
        * Python: http://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/python
        * JavaScript: http://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/javascript
        * Learnstreet also has lessons the way Codecademy does: http://www.learnstreet.com/lessons/languages/

**Our request to students:** if you feel like you've made it past the beginner level, think about the things you'd love to learn next, and then discuss your ideas with your parents and with mentors when you visit the dojo next. **Even better:** you can start to explore the links under bullet 2 above and get started on your own, and then ask us questions about stuff you want to learn more about! If you find other free materials that help your learning process, please let us and other students know about those too. 

**Our request to mentors:** these are a few ideas we came up with in our last dojo review / prep call. We'd like to hear other ideas or improvements too. Outside of the calls, the best way to get in touch with us and be heard by a number of other mentors is our public HipChat channel at: http://www.hipchat.com/gnmHyMrCp

**Our request to parents:** please keep your good feedback coming, keep spreading the word about Coder Dojo, and help your students continue to build on the enthuasiasm they've been showing!

**Saturday the 24th's dojo:**

We're still working on the outline for the sessions we'll have, but it will be similar to the first few, with the addition of making more time to talk with intermediate to advanced students about their goals and projects.

Thanks, and see you Saturday!

#CoderDojo Prep Session Notes:

Open question: How to best support multiple levels of skill?

- Scoreboard style -- Basic, Intermediate, Advanced (See Khan)
- CodeAcademy -- and other existing resources

- Ask on CoderDojo forums: 
	- Implement this? http://coderdojo.com/about-us/belt-rankings/
		- Josh: find more info on this, post on Forums, ask Rebecca from NYC	
		- Josh: send request to mailing list to ask parents if their kids would be interested in helping other newbies
		- See also: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges
		- OpenHatch model: https://openhatch.org/
- How to see "current step / goal" for a student?		
- Stations idea: 
  -   Topical, "staffed" by a mentor to help a student get something specific done, like:
    - Get Python installed
    - Get WebMatrix
    - Get Sublime Text 2/3 installed
    - Download Bootstrap
    - Download JQuery
    - etc
    - Language Trouble shooting station / Debugging station
- Admin ideas: http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Administrative_Resources


Josh: Tic Tac Toe -> JavaScript 

Jim notes:

- Not seeing self-direction yet
- Keep momentum
- Many still, and will still, see this as a classroom, not a gymnasium
- http://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/python

Tracking:
- need to track levels of completion, 'badges' for students
