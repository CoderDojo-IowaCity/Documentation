# The Game
* Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game normally played on paper where 2 players take turns and try to get 3 in a row to win
* Everyone has played it
* Everyone knows the rules
* It's an easy way to learn some programming basics
* It's also fun to make it more sophisticated, like 7 by 7 boards where you must get 5 in a row to win!
* And, it's a fun thing to play against your friends over the internet or using mobile phones or tablets

# The Code

We have code samples of the game implemented with varying levels of sophistication

## Simple game that doesn't even keep score (Keep score yourself, no better than a sheet of paper!)
